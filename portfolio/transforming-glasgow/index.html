<p>At the end of the 2 year Future Cities programme - which functioned independently from the city government - I was brought in-house to work on the council&rsquo;s $250m transformation programme. I was remanded to the team tasked with finding data-led solutionst to financial and organisational challenges.</p>
<p>My previous role had set me up well - with a good network of the data stakeholders and knowledge of how to work with and around the beaurocratic challenges that come along with a large political institution.</p>
<p>Over the following 2 years I worked on more than a dozen fascinating projects across the entire domain of the council’s work - and my work directly impacted countles services and led to a considerable quantifiable impact in the city which I&rsquo;m extremely proud of.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy &amp; Compliance</strong></p>
<p>One of the most compelling elements to the work was working with extremely sensitive datasets - guarded by some real and some more perceived privacy concerns in the nascent era of GDPR.</p>
<p>I developed a close working relationship with the privacy and compliance leadership - learning in detail the regulatory context and allowing me to make rational and positive cases for internal data sharing and unlocking valuable data resources inside the organisation.</p>
<p>Ultimately the impact I was able to have was a result of this cross disciplinary approach and an excellent model for innovation in a tightly regulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits auto entitlement</strong></p>
<p>This project was significant as it started small, but ended up having a great impact.</p>
<p>There was a programme run by the city to hand out food benefits to certain demographics. The process required these beneficiaries to apply and included means testing - which is costly and time consuming to administer.</p>
<p>I was able to bring together multiple data sources - including the central government dataset for means testing benefits recipients - and use probablistic data matching to automatically determine and pay out the benefits to the elligible beneficiaries.</p>
<p>This project raised percent of those who were elliglbe vs those who we covered from ~75% to 96%, meanwhile reducing the cost of administration by nearly 95%.</p>
<p>As an unexpected bonus - there were other government programmes that were tied to these food benefits - so we ended up inadvertantly bringing just under $10 million new funds into the city with this programme, in addition to the cost reduction and additional grants.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom of Information Requests</strong></p>
<p>This was another quick win with a big impact. The council spent significant amounts of budget each year servicing freedom of information requests from the public and civil society.</p>
<p>The system for submitting these requests was archaic - and a lack of knowledge resources on both the public and public service side meant a lot of time was wasted on requests that would ultimately be denied.</p>
<p>I was tasked to look at this and see what we could do with respect to publishing the most frequently requested datasets - processed and ready for consumption - so the team traiging the requests could point to these datasets and significantly reduce the cost and time spent on them.</p>
<p>My approach was twofold - firstly to do some data cataloguing around the main valuable data resources inside the organisation - to help build a more intuitive and shared understanding of who had what and what it was.</p>
<p>The second was to do some NLP text procesing on the FOI requests themselves to build a quantatative model of what people were after.</p>
<p>We ended up taking this a bit further with setting up API&rsquo;s to automatically publish the high-demand datasets. I particularly enjoyed working on this project because it had a big financial impact despite the original idea being so obvious - it could have been easily overlooked.</p>
